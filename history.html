It was a first for Ireland and destined to keep going<br> for a very long time. <br>The following year it became a weekend camping event.<br> Nobody quite new what to expect but with a line-up including Groove Armada, 2 Many DJ’s, Super Furry Animals, Mylo and Soulwax, comedy and theatre,<br> great food Electric Picnic started off with a bang.<br>The festival was christened ‘The festival of good intentions’, with its laid back attitude and nothing else in the country to rival it,<br> it is no wonder that Electric Picnic became firmly entrenched as a must go to event in the Festival calendar.</p>

Interpol, The Rapture and Sinead O’Connor finished up on the first night of the festival, leaving the crowd in the hands of James Blake, Public Enemy, Pulp and Underworld for entertainment. Arcade Fire were the act everyone was talking about after they took to the main stage on Saturday night with the help of balloons and Chinese lanterns, it would be hard not to enjoy their magical performance.<br>The Comedy tent continued to please with acts such as David O’Doherty, Abandoman and Barry Murphy curing the sore heads with a good laugh-out-loud set for the audience.
